Nginx Syntax Highlighting Plugin
================================

This is a syntax highlighting plugin for Nginx configuration files in Sublime Text 2/3 that isn't completely broken. I was using the least broken plugin out there, [kvs/ST2Nginx](https://github.com/kvs/ST2Nginx), but it was pretty broken for my Nginx files.

With this plugin, I have fixed many of those bugs and will actively maintain and extend it, as I frequently work with Nginx.
